## Content

This python notebook provides step by step instruction on how to import select files, analyze data, use pandas and display the data in multiple different formats.

It is broken up into three main portions: 

- First is importing data, which is specifically formatted for Google Colab which involves mounting your Google Drive and using the appropriate file path to the folder you are working in. It then walks you through how to import .csv files and how to import their data as useable arrays. These arrays then can be used to complete analysis. Appropriate examples are provided.
- Secondly after the data import is done successfully. Working with data is described and examples are given. The basics of the plotting data is provided as well as more detailed examples to include different plots that are available for use. 
- Thirdly data fitting and exporting images and files are explained with details and appropriate examples are provided with step by step instructions. 

Note: that these cells are expandable that makes it easier to locate the information you are looking for.

## How to use

This is a python note book, so you can load it into multiple different locations. You can use Google Colab (where it was originally written to be) but it will also work on Jupyter Hub, Jupyter, Alder and any python text editor loaded in as a python file. 

Note: If you load it as a python file, the markdown blocks will be commented out sections of text. But it will still run.
